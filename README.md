Setting up a .env file - 

I created a file named ".env.example" in which you have an example of what another file named ".env" should be. It should be created in the root directory ( same level as the "package.json" file ) and you just need to put your own gemini api key that you can get for free from the web ( at least the free version of it ), then just paste your own key in the placeholder and it should all be done and the website work.
